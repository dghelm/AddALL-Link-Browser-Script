# Insert AddAll.com Search to Amazon Pages

This is a simple browser script for Chrome, but their security stuff makes it a pain to keep activated unless I actually submit it to the Chrome store. I had a resolution this year to stop spending so much money on Amazon through book purchases, and this helps to quickly find used books from a variety of sources.

## Installation

For firefox, use greasemonkey. For chrome, you might have to download the .js file, visit chrome://extensions and then drag the file onto the page.

## Usage

On a Amazon book page, look underneath the ISBNs below the book image.
